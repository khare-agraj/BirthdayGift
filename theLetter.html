My license to officially call you 22! It's crazy how I feel as if I just met you the other day with a screen in front of us, some people might find it weird as to how two people who just met on discord could be so close. It is absolutely beyond me how fast the time has passed and the sheer amount of memories we have made. Some good, some bad and some traumatic (I still feel weird crossing that police station). <br>So coming to the matter at hand, A very Happy Birthday HoneyBunSugarPlum you are an absolute delight to be with and I cannot verbally express how much I appreciate you being in my life. You are indeed a great companion who is patient yet impulsive and a tad bit clingy :p . I wish you all the happiness in the world and I hope you prosper with every step you take in life. Never Settle. (copyrights to OnePlus)&nbsp;<br>Now that the main agenda is completed, coming to the other important things. So I want to thank you for a lot of things, but as far as I can remember... Thank you for the Cadbury Fruit and Nut, the numerous organisms ;) and for being so so so so so patient with all my tantrums, mood swings and bad behaviour. I can't thank you enough for sticking by even after all we went through. Everybody needs a Shruti in their lives, someone reliable on whom you can lay anything. I know you desperately want my Air Jordan Tee but I want it too, so there's a conflict of interest but someday you shall get it. Not now. Someday. Also I wanna apologise for not being able to give you enough time, I certainly have a lot on my plate as of now, with the applications, college etc. etc. It's all a mess right now. But I hope things go as per plan, such that we have a reason to celebrate.<br>So I really hope you have a great year ahead, filled with joy, excitement and success. I hope you get the best of all worlds, because babe you deserve nothing less.<br><br>P.S. - Please follow the order and don't skip sections, I really hope you like what I have made for you.<br><br><br>From, Agraj Khare<br></span></div>
